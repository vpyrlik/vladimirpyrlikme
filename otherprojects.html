							I find teaching a very important and fascinating part of my job in academia. Over the 15+ years of my teaching experience, I've been in a variety of roles and positions. From a junior assistant for a small class of students to a senior lecturer and a solo designer of a massive core course for a 180+ students that combines a classic classroom work with lots of synch and asynch online teaching, and interactive content. I've done a good share of personal tutoring, as well as individual or small group supervision of students' work.</br></br>
							The challenge of moving the classes into the online framework signigicantly influenced my teaching practice. Even now, when a lot of schools are returning back to the original off-line classes, I continue using and sometimes experimenting with the online teaching techniques and various interactive tools to enhance my classes, to make them more efficient for my students.</br></br>
							A short description of my recent teaching projects is presented below.

							<b>Econometrics I</b></br>
						  <i>Fall semester of 2021/22 (Work in progress). HSE University. Bac in Economics programme. St. Petersburg, Russia.</i></br>
							This is a core course for <a href="https://spb.hse.ru/en/ba/economics/">bachelor in Economics</a> students in <a href="https://spb.hse.ru/en/">HSE University in St. Petersburg, Russia</a>. The enrollment is about 180 students. The course was supported by <a href="https://www.cerge-ei.cz/teaching-fellows">CERGE-EI Foundation Graduate Teaching Fellows program</a>.</br></br>
							The course binds together the whole core econometrics, statistics, and data analysis track of the economics programme. The course corresponds to the goals and the mission of the programme itself, hence, it aims to provide the students with a variety of skills and practical tools of empirical data analysis with a strong focus on their ability to answer substantive economic questions using real life data and statistical analysis tools.</br></br>
							For the first time on the programme, a big core course is being delivered in an innovative format, with a substantial part of the material delivered in the form of online tutorials and compulsory slef-directed coursework and self-control tasks. The lectures are online and take at most one third of the total synchronous coursework, while the practice sessions take twice as much time and are held in computer classes and combine practicing the empirical work along with working on development of analytical skills.</br></br>
							To support the students' motivation, provide and recieve feedback, assess and grade the work a variety of interactive tools is employed. We run regular interactive quizzes, provide small group consultations to support the group project work, use a 24x7 chat with the students for Q&As for the teachers and communication between the students themselves.</br></br>
							The materials of the course are not yet available (will be early in 2022, after the course ends).

							<b>Time Series Econometrics</b></br>
						  <i>Spring semester of 2020/21. HSE University. Bac in Economics programme. St. Petersburg, Russia.</i></br>
							The course was designed for the 3d year <a href="https://spb.hse.ru/en/ba/economics/">bachelor in Economics</a> students majoring in economics and mathematics in <a href="https://spb.hse.ru/en/">HSE University in St. Petersburg, Russia</a>. The enrollment was about 90 students. The course was supported by <a href="https://www.cerge-ei.cz/teaching-fellows">CERGE-EI Foundation Graduate Teaching Fellows program</a>. The course was delivered in English and fully online. </br></br>
							The main goal of the course was to provide students with necessary tools for practical skills development in the area of time seriesdata analysis, particularly, getting familiar with practical task of a time series prediction. This part of the course was organized in the form of an empirical team progject work, which, in addition, helped the students to develop effective communication, team work, and basic project management skills. </br></br>
							A set of interactive tools was used to arganize the course work and make it efficient. For example, regular online quizzes on an interactive platform supported the students' motivation to keep up with the self-directed studies and allowed them to provide feedback about the course in real-time.</br></br>

							<b>Introduction into Julia</b></br>
						  <i>Fall semester of 2020/21. CERGE-EI PhD in Economics programme, Prague, the Czech Republic.</i></br>
							The head of the programme required a short series of practical classes for the newly admitted PhD in Economics students to get familiar with <a href="https://julialang.org/">the programming language Julia</a>.</br></br>
							The course was held fully online and covered the basic concepts of the programming language with a focus on the tools that seemed particularly useful in the students' future coursework.

							<b><a href="https://www.cerge-ei.cz/discovery/">Economics Discovery Hub</a> courses</b></br>
							Earlier I also designed and taught similar courses on the programming language R (the basics and the use for data analysis) for the Economics Discovery Hub project at CERGE-EI.</br></br>
